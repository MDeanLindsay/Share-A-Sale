# Share-A-Sale
Automating the auditing of affiliate marketer commissions.

## Situation
We use Share-A-Sale for affiliate link marketing. Antiquated product, but simple and generally works.
Returning customer sales recieve a 10% commission rate, new customer sales recieve a 30% commission rate.

## Problem
Noticed "new customer" orders drastically dwarfed what we typically see in DTC new/returning customers.
Saw areas for improvement when it came voiding orders containing inelligible items.

## Outcome
Can now easily check order numbers against our database to correct commission rates, void commissions containing inelligible items, void commissions of orders canceled by external sources such as customer service/charge backs, and identified and corrected an issue with Share A Sale reporting inflated order totals/commission payouts when a discount code is used.
